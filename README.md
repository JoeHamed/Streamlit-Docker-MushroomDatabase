# Binary Classification Web App: Edible vs Poisonous Mushrooms üçÑ

This project is a **binary classification web application** built with **Streamlit**. It predicts whether mushrooms are **edible** or **poisonous** based on user-input features. The app supports multiple classifiers, including **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forests**. It provides visualization of model performance metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve.
